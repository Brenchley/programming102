# Introduction to Linux (Bash) Shell

You can start the shell in a number of ways. The most common is to use a terminal emulator program. As its name suggests, this runs a shell inside a program window on your Desktop; by clicking Applications > Accessories > Terminal or `ctr + alt + T` keyboard combination.

Below this is the most important component of the terminal window: **the command prompt** — a few words followed by the dollar symbol ($). On our test system, this is what we see:
`prof@prof:~$`

>*Note:* The first part is the username—the user account we created during installation and use to log in to the PC. After the @ sign is the hostname of the PC, which we also chose when installing Ubuntu. The hostname of the PC isn’t important on most home systems, but assumes relevance if the PC is part of a network. The @ sign tells us that we are running user `prof` on the computer with the hostname `prof`.

After the colon is the current directory you’re browsing. In this example, the tilde symbol (~) appears instead of an actual path or directory name. This is merely Linux shorthand for the user’s `/home` directory.

>*Note:* If you were to log in as root, a hash (#) would appear instead of the $ prompt. This is important to remember, because often in magazines and some computer manuals, the use of the hash symbol before a command indicates that it should be run as root
